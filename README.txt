This is a clone of the Google Nigeria Homepage

It is optimised on Google Chrome.However, it is not responsive (like the original Google
homepage); however, it is partly fluid.

There are minor issues on Mozilla and Explorer. Both of these browsers change the background
color of the  search button when hovered on.

Mozilla also increases the font weight of the button labels.

The project is untested on mobile browsers and other destktop browsers.


Thanks
